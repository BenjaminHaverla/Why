# Why?

The only option for me was to study hard with the English language and work on myself. Maybe that’s the reason why teachers had a strong influence on me.
**"Awesome…"**
Yes, I said it loudly in front of my English teacher from primary school. Believe me or not, it wasn’t that *awesome*. When she heard that word, her voice grew louder: "Never say it again! Not in front of me!" That was the point when my existential questioning began. Why did she say that? Is it wrong? Did I use bad grammar? If it’s wrong, then why was it used in a video parody? Because she was strict, I wasn’t brave enough to ask her why.
